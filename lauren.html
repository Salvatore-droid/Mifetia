                <p><strong>Dear Love, <i>My Lauren</i>--I can't play a guitar but i can do this for you.</strong></p>
                <p> 
                    Dance with me under the diamonds, See me like breath in the cold.
                    Sleep with me here in the silence, come kiss me silver and gold.
                    You say that i won't loose you but you can't predict the future so just hold on like you would never let go.
                    If you ever move on without me, I need to make sure you know,, that YOU, are the only one i'll ever love. I gotta tell you.
                    Gotta tell you, yeah YOU, if it's not you it's not anyone, looking back on my life you're the only good i've ever done.It's YOU, 
                    if it's not you it's not anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before there was not enough time to love you the way that i want, cause every morning i find you i feel the day that i done.
                    You say that i won't loose you but you can't predict the future  cause certain things are out of our control, If you ever move on without me,
                    I need to make sure you know. YOU, are the only one i'll ever love, YOU,, if it's not you it's not anyone, looking back on my life
                    you're the only good I've ever done. If it's not you it's not anyone.IF IT"S NOT YOU IT"S NOT ANYONE.
